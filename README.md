First of all `npm install` to retrieve all the dependencies.

#### Versioning
To ease the access to each version 3 branchs were created each one containing a specific version.

 - v1.2 - Streaming feature

The branch master is the most updated one and may contain some adjustments, like this readme, and some more tests.

#### Starting the application
Before starting the application you should add your github username and password to the configurations file in `src/configs/config.js`.

Afterwards just `npm start` to see the magic happening.

#### Testing
To run the tests run `npm test` 

And that's it! Enjoy.
